RobustJS let you design your system anyway you want. To get started, let's use official CLI tool.

```bash
  npm install -g @robust/cli
```

## 1. Using templates

Scaffold your `my-api` API app using api template:

```bash
robust new api my-api
```

Now your API is ready to use with command `robust serve`, then you can open it on [localhost:3000](//localhost:3000)

## 2. Available templates

Here is a list of available templates:

- api
- console
- mvc (coming soon)

## 3. Other CLI commands

A list of all CLI commands are available at [CLI Guide](guide-cli)
